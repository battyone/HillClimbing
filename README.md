# HillClimbing
The CRL ThreadPool HillClimibing algorithm in C#

Based / inspired on Matt Warren's [The CLR Thread Pool 'Thread Injection' Algorithm](http://mattwarren.org/2017/04/13/The-CLR-Thread-Pool-Thread-Injection-Algorithm/) article and [code](https://github.com/mattwarren/HillClimbingClrThreadPool).

Basically, this repository contains the respective  CLR (C++) source code ported C#.


To create the graphs that are also shown in Matt's article, do as follows:

1. Install Microsoft R Client.
2. Run the 'install.packages("ggplot2")' command in "Rgui.exe"
3. Run the following command for the files generated by "HillClimbing.exe"
 
```
 "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\R Client\R_SERVER\bin\x64\rscript.exe" CreateGraphs.R results-random.txt random.png
 "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\R Client\R_SERVER\bin\x64\rscript.exe" CreateGraphs.R results-smooth.txt smooth.png
```
